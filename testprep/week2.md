  - Open access
  - Creative Commons

### Questions
- When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

MIT Liscence:
We chose this for our project. It also for free use of code. 

GPL: 
Allows people to anything other that distribute the project. Requires people like qualcomn to split up product in order to make money while using the liscence. 

Creative Commons:
Waives copyright interest; part of the public domain. 

- Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
I chose MIT liscence for both team and project as we wish for our code to be used for the benefit of all people, therefore it would be best to have few restrictions on what people want to do with it. This allows for maximum benefits. 

## 5.6
Personal Identifiable Information:
- can be used in identity theft
- main search history

  - Can be exploited if privacy is ignored

Risks :
- location and ip are known
- Stores w/ cameras can store your image
  - info can be online and difficult to remove
  - can be used against people

Authentication:
- protect devices and info from other access
  - Measures strong passwords and 2FA

Virus and Malware:
- Can  gain access to  information
- meant to damage computer
Encryption:
- Prevents unauthorized access
Decryption:
- Decoding data

### Questions
- Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

Sometimes code will show API keys that can be taken for malicious purposes. 

- What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

PII needs to be protected by all individuals as there are a variety of ways in which a variety of individuals can access personal information. When privacy is this hard to maintain, its even more important to protect personal information online, as its far harder to delete data online than in real life. 

- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

A good password is one that does not contain any PII, is unique, and is not easy to guess by a third party. It should have a mix of capital and lowercase, numbers, letter, and special characters. 

- Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symetric encryption involves the use of one secret key to encrypt and decrypt information. Asymetric/public key encryption is when two keys are used. One will be public and the other private. 

- Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.

Encryption is used in deployment with HTTPs which uses SSL certificates to make websites more secure. 

- Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

Lots of scam companies often send emails attempting to bait the user into sending PII. I have recieved many such email.
