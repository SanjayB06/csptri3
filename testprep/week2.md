Sometimes code will show API keys that can be taken for malicious purposes. 

- What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

PII needs to be protected by all individuals as there are a variety of ways in which a variety of individuals can access personal information. When privacy is this hard to maintain, its even more important to protect personal information online, as its far harder to delete data online than in real life. 

- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

A good password is one that does not contain any PII, is unique, and is not easy to guess by a third party. It should have a mix of capital and lowercase, numbers, letter, and special characters.
