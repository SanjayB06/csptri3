## 5.1

### 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

| Beneficial  | Harmful  |
|---|---|
| Technological innovations can help conserve paper (less physical books and documents. )  | People will spend more time in front of screens which can cause eye strain or bad posture.   |
| Technological innovations can reduce the need for human beings to work in manual labour occupations.  | This can cause companies to lay off employees and cause unemployment.  |
| Technological innovations can lessen the amount of work humans need to do (online shopping, food delivery, etc.) . | This can cause human beings to become less active and more sedentary and have negative health affects if people always stay indoors.   |


### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues do exist for high schoolers in the modern age. Lots of apps and games can be very addicting and require people to constantly check their phones, laptops, etc. This can impact high schoolers as addiction to games and social media will prevent them from putting full effort into their work, leading to a decline in grades and success. 


## 5.2

### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?


In a digital world, people can empower themselves by gaining a better understanding of technology and computing in order to take advantage of modern technology. You can empower yourself by using technology to its full potential, even in non technical fields. 

### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.


Someone who is empowered could help someone who is not empowered through increased advocacy for policies that extend tech education and internet access to the less fortunate. On an individual level, those who are empowered could help others better understand technology and its uses/powers. 

### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

There is some red tape blocking digital empowerment. For those who do not have internet access at home, it is not nearly as easy to empower themselves as it is for others. Those without access at home will have to rely on public places such as libraries for computer access; these places will often have some form of restriction or regulation on what can be done. At Del Norte there is some red tape as well, as it is required to get several levels of permissions in order to install software. 

## 5.3

### Video Questions
- Does the owner think it was intentional?
Probably not, but it was likely tested using mainly white people so they didn't think to train the computer to recognize people of different skin colors. 
- How do you think this happened?
The program was likely developed and tested by predominantly white people, so it was implicitly skewed towards white people. It may not have been intentional, but the program only recognizes white faces because that is how it was created and tested. 
- Is it harmful? Was it intended to be harmful?
It is harmful because it excludes a large number of people from using these programs and having access to new technologies. It was probably not intended to be harmful, although there is no way to confirm. 
- Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected in order to ensure that computing innovations are available to all people and to ensure that they do not work differently solely due to skin color. 
- What would/should you do to produce a better outcome?
Have a more diverse team of developers who can help train the algorithm to recognize all races and test it with various individuals of different skin colors to confirm that the algorithm works in all different cases.
