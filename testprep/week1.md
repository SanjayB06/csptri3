### Notes

- reflect existing biases
    - due to biases written in 
    - biases present in environment
- action should be taken to eliminate biases
- can be at any level of development

### Video Questions
- Does the owner think it was intentional?
Probably not, but it was likely tested using mainly white people so they didn't think to train the computer to recognize people of different skin colors. 
- How do you think this happened?
The program was likely developed and tested by predominantly white people, so it was implicitly skewed towards white people. It may not have been intentional, but the program only recognizes white faces because that is how it was created and tested. 
- Is it harmful? Was it intended to be harmful?
It is harmful because it excludes a large number of people from using these programs and having access to new technologies. It was probably not intended to be harmful, although there is no way to confirm. 
- Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected in order to ensure that computing innovations are available to all people and to ensure that they do not work differently solely due to skin color. 
- What would/should you do to produce a better outcome?
Have a more diverse team of developers who can help train the algorithm to recognize all races and test it with various individuals of different skin colors to confirm that the algorithm works in all different cases.

### Questions

- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

A crowdsource Idea could be a project that makes studying for CSP easier. The project could include various TPT notes / TT projects as well as tutorials and runtime examples. Crowdsourcing could be used by having all students be able to contribute material based on their experience, or provide suggestions for features. This would be useful since the students would have the best knowledge of what is needed. 

- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

Our teams final project would be better with crowdsourcing from all of del norte. This is because our project is meant to make studying easier for students, especially high school students. This means that having input and contributions from a large number of high school students would allow us to add features that would actually benefit students.
