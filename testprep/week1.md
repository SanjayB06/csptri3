### Video Questions
- Does the owner think it was intentional?
Probably not, but it was likely tested using mainly white people so they didn't think to train the computer to recognize people of different skin colors. 
- How do you think this happened?
The program was likely developed and tested by predominantly white people, so it was implicitly skewed towards white people. It may not have been intentional, but the program only recognizes white faces because that is how it was created and tested. 
- Is it harmful? Was it intended to be harmful?
It is harmful because it excludes a large number of people from using these programs and having access to new technologies. It was probably not intended to be harmful, although there is no way to confirm. 
- Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected in order to ensure that computing innovations are available to all people and to ensure that they do not work differently solely due to skin color. 
- What would/should you do to produce a better outcome?
Have a more diverse team of developers who can help train the algorithm to recognize all races and test it with various individuals of different skin colors to confirm that the algorithm works in all different cases.
